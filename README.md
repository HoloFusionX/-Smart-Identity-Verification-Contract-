# IdentityVerification Smart Contract

## Overview

The IdentityVerification smart contract allows users to verify their identity on the blockchain by paying a specified fee. Verified user data and timestamps are stored securely on the Ethereum network. The contract owner has the authority to manage verification-related functions and fees.

## Features

- Identity verification for users through a fee payment.
- Storage of verified user data and timestamps.
- Contract owner can manage verification fee, user data, and verification status.
- Verified users can update their identity data.

## How to Compile and Deploy

Follow these steps to compile and deploy the IdentityVerification smart contract:

1. Make sure you have a Solidity development environment set up, such as Remix or Truffle.

2. Copy the provided Solidity code from the contract file.

3. Compile the contract using your chosen Solidity development environment. Make sure to select the appropriate compiler version (e.g., ^0.8.0).

4. Deploy the contract to a local or test network. You can use tools like Remix or Truffle to deploy the contract. Remember to select the account you want to deploy from and specify the required verification fee.

5. After deploying, interact with the contract using its functions to verify identity, update user data, manage verification fees, and more.

## Usage Example

1. Deploy the contract on a development network.
2. Use the `verifyIdentity` function to verify a user's identity by sending the required verification fee.
3. Verified users can call the `getUserData` function to retrieve their verified data.
4. The contract owner can update the verification fee using the `setVerificationFee` function.
5. Verified users can update their verified data using the `updateIdentity` function.

## Note

This smart contract provides a basic example of identity verification and may require additional security measures for production deployment. Always exercise caution and follow best practices when working with smart contracts.
